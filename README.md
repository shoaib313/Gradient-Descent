# Gradient-Descent
The core of machine learning is optimization, and the core of optimization is Gradient Descent. This simple yet powerful algorithm is the engine that drives machines to "learn" from data. Whether it's training a neural network to recognize images or fine-tuning a predictive model for stock prices, gradient descent is the foundation of it all.
